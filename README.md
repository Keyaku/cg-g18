* [ ] **Track**: Use `Math.PI` instead of `3.14`.
* [ ] **Track**: Apply `Tire extends RigidBody`.
* [ ] **Track**: By doing `obj.add(this.mesh)`, you're completely ignoring the Class object construction, making this as useful as just another method. After extending Tire from a RigidBody, remove `this.mesh.add(mesh)` and use `obj.add(this)`.
* [ ] **Track**: You also did this in Track, but that's less relevant so do whatever you wish.
